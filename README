This project is currently only views. The small backend is for providing sample data

==== SETUP ====

cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
bundle
rake db:migrate db:seed
rails s


==== TODO ====

- episode#show page
- tag#show page (default)
- tag#show page (actor/ppl)
- programs#search result page

==== Things to workout ====
- really simple auth without any hassle (google account signup?)
- api protection, probably using devise for this (https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
- Connect dtv-api to dtv-client for series data
